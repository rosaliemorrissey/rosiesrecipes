        <p id="first">The first time I remember making Grandma's Chocolate was at my Grandma's condo in preparation for a birthday party later in the day. My
            Grandma provided me all the "secret" tips with how to add the coffee that adds the extra punch to the frosting, these tips that made me feel
            like I was entering a secret club were passed down to my Grandma by her mother, Rose.

        <p id="second">Rose Klienerman immigrated with her family to the United States from Russia in 1920. Her family settled in Pittsburg. was active in her community and a prominient member of within the Women organization of her synagogue. Rose's husband, Sam,
            owned and ran a grocery store in the Pittsburg neighborhood Squirrel Hill. Early in their marriage the couple had to navigate the Great
            Depression, during which Rose developed this recipe for Chocolate Cake.

        <p id="third">This is a true family recipe, being developed by my Great-Grandmother Rose passed on to her daughter, my Grandma, Beverly. Beverly says that it
            is fine that I share this recipe with you, you just must refer to it as "Grandma's Chocolate Cake." This recipe is a classic in our family and
            can be seen in many birthday photos!
