            <div class="story">
            <p>Mary Morrissey proudly worked as a nurse while raising her five kids in Dedham, MA. Mary excelled in the kitchen and was always the one
                to have family recipes avaliable. She even went so far as to record other family recipes from family members who only measured by eye.</p>
            <p>Always looking for new recipes to try, Mary often referred to the Boston Globe's "Confidential Chat" a column that had a majority female
                readership. The column covered a variety of topics including stain removal, child rearing, and recipes! While no one is 100% certain were
                the recipe came from, it is a favorite in the family, and while we all try no one can make them quite like Nana could.</p>
            <p>I was very lucky to spend time with my Nana during my childhood. A day at Nana's always contained two things, a craft and a snack. I hope
                you enjoy these cookies that mean so much to my family and always bring us joy!</p>
